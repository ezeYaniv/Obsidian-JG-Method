- CUID (Collision Resistant IDs)
- Package that you gives you near unique IDs (a duplicate ID will be returned very rarely)

#### Resolving Errors
- Instructor's approach is first getting as much information about the problem as possible. Also, you shouldn't go to the code until you fully understand what the error is trying to tell you.

#### Example with Code
- Blah
``` js
function blah() {
	console.log("Blah")
}
```
